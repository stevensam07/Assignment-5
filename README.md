# Assignment-5

In the DATA 1200 course, we worked on a project using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The project involves training the model with data, testing how well it works, and improving it. We will write the code in Python, using tools like TensorFlow or Keras.

To share our work and help others follow along, we will set up a GitHub repository. It will include:

A README.md file explaining the project, how the code is organized, how to set it up, and how to run it.
The Python code for the ANN.
Information in the README.md about common problems and how to fix them.
Using GitHub helps keep track of changes and allows others to collaborate and use our project easily.

## Getting Started
We will be using a csv file "drugsetdata.csv" which has the data of Age,	Sex,	BP,	Cholesterol,	Na_to_K, Drug

### Prerequisites

Import required libraries that is needed in Phython:

```bash
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
